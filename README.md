Project Description:

I wanted to do something fun and creative for my project, something that would be a unique, fresh piece for my portfolio. As I am a designer, and ultimately want to focus more on web design than development, I felt like this idea marries the two together. The project that I decided on will focus on the promotional website of a currently fictitious video game. My husband is focusing as the “client”, since he’s the avid gamer and may at some future point try to develop a game based on this content.

Here is an outline of the basic premise of the game, which will help me when I’m promoting it on my website and lead creative direction:

Jake and friends get ready for a night out. This is the starting point and the jumping off point for missions and activities. Game is multi-player, can play online with friends.

Game starts with each player in their respective houses, your first mission is to get successfully to the bar/restaurant area to meet up with your buddies. You can steal cars, bikes, hijack taxis, whatever you “need” to do to complete your mission.

At the end of that mission, you make first contact with the infected "patient zero". The next mission is to contain the damage and minimize further zombie attacks to restaurant goers.

From there, specific missions are based on your home base location, and your route back to your home base location to rescue your wife/family. Each character has a home base in one of several “boroughs” or sections of town.
Next, you need to get to your wife's brothers on the outskirts of the "boroughs" and protect all your provisions until you reach your safe-house location in the country.

Along the way, you will be able to steal vehicles, food and other items for survival, crash cars and, run over, fight, and otherwise eliminate other players, kill zombies and other threats, get chased by cops, rival players, and other enemies, and in general create and survive in pandemonium.

The promotional website will: provide a summary, features list, character bios, game video/screenshots (I’m not sure how I will accomplish this yet), user forum, what’s new section, newsletter sign-up, contact us form, and a buy now option.
